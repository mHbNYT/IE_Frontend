                  garbage collection, structural typing,
                    and CSP-style concurrency.

            Ask yourself while you're reading / google for whether the material is still in use, or ever was. The Set-Cookie2 header was never adopted, digest authentication never really took off either, for example... I still recommend reading this book because I think the history of the web is important to understand and be able to speak about, and mst of the details are still relevant - I think as of today most servers are still using HTTP 1.1, and HTTP 1.1 is still the foundation off HTTP 2.0. This book also gives a good broad perspective on how HTTP fits into the broader internet, and how different components use it - it calls itself a general primer on the web. Another problem with this book is the authors repeated the same information 3-4 in alot of places. But at the end of the day there's alot of good, very important information here, and I haven't source for it so I do recommend reading it still.

            What makes it so painful is that this is such an essential book for this language, a legitimate successor for K&R (and probably the only one) for the only language that really could be considered a contemporary replacement for C. I will try to expand further at a later time (with an update to this review) on that perspective and where I think the content of this book fails, as no book is perfect, certainly not K&R, but given the damning paragraph above it would be deceptive to say anything more than the following sentences: The content is excellent and essential. It unquestionably has helped me, and will help me in the future. It would be helpful to anybody trying to learn Go who has some prior programming experience. It is the ideal book to read after doing 'A Tour of Go' (tour.golang.org) if you want to learn about Go and how to use it.

            This book requires no previous knowledge to understand it. Though itâ€™s worth noting that it goes a bit fast on some pages. If you have a terrible memory and need tons of examples on 1 thing, Iâ€™d go with the head first guide to HTML CSS & XHTML. That book goes over everything at a LOT slower pace. I read that book before this one and I still found things I didnâ€™t know about HTML and CSS. I have been programming for a few months now and Iâ€™ve learned a ton of helpful things from this book that I never knew before, which is cool. The book had 50-star quality! I bought my book new due to the complaints of people getting broken books. The new book option is worth it if you are a person that hates even the slightest dent in your book. If you donâ€™t care about the condition and only want the knowledge then used is good too.
